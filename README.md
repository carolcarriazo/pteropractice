# pteropractice
Code compiled by SWRI Boulder interns during the summer of 2015.

These scripts were developed in cooperation with Eliot Young, a Principal Scientist at the Southwest Research Institute's
Space Science Division in Boulder, CO. Eliot provided most of the starter code for the scripts that you see here.

Collaborators include: me (Charlie Watson), Kara Hartig, Aaron Resnick, Jason Mackie, and Carolina Carriazo.

These files were used as part of the data reduction pipeline for the data we collected off the June 29 2015 Stellar Occultation by Pluto
of a magnitude 15 star visible only from the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting photometric analysis of the star's lightcurve as Pluto passed in front of it helped us characterize Pluto's atmospheric haze, oblateness, temperature, and pressure. The resulting findings were
compiled in a conference poster that we presented at the October 2015 American Astronomical Society Meeting - Division of Planetary
Sciences in Washington, D.C.

P.S. If you're wondering why the name of this repo is "pteropractice" it's because that summer, we interns nicknamed
ourselves "The Pterodactyls".....BRAAAAAWWWWKKK!!!!
